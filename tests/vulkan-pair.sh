# Policy fixture for the coupled Vulkan pair — 2026-09-25 incident
# (docs/NOTE.md "vulkan pair" section): a `-s` batch kept vulkan-headers-git
# at 1.4.363 while vulkan-icd-loader-git fetched upstream v1.4.364, whose
# CMake requires VulkanHeaders >= its own ${PROJECT_VERSION} — a cryptic
# "not compatible with the version requested" error mid-build().
#
# The live fix is a paired rebuild with -i (never -s: the skip predicate is
# stale-by-construction for VCS recipes). What this fixture pins is the
# hardening: the loader declares a VERSIONED vulkan-headers makedepends
# derived from its own pkgver base, so a stale provider fails at
# "Checking buildtime dependencies" with an actionable message instead.
#
# Read-only: asserts on committed recipe text; mutates nothing.
