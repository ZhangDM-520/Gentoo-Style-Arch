# Run the whole fixture battery. Every fixture is self-contained and
# non-mutating: they build scratch trees under $TMPDIR, diff committed metadata,
# stub sudo/pacman/date through PATH, and assert on the builder's own output, so
# this is safe on a working checkout — and, crucially, safe to run fixtures
# CONCURRENTLY: no fixture writes anything another fixture reads. That rule is
# what the parallel default below rests on; a new fixture that breaks it is a
# bug in the fixture, not a reason to drop -j.
#
# Usage:
#   tests/run-all.sh               # every fixture, in parallel
#   tests/run-all.sh recipe        # only fixtures whose name matches "recipe"
#   tests/run-all.sh -j 4          # cap concurrency at 4
#   tests/run-all.sh --serial      # one at a time (debugging a flaky fixture)
#   RUN_ALL_JOBS=2 tests/run-all.sh
#
# Order is alphabetical (stable and maintenance-free) and the report is printed
# in that order too, regardless of completion order; discovery is recursive with
# tests/assets/ excluded (frozen reference material there never runs standalone),
# so a new fixture needs no edit here. Shared helper code lives in tests/lib/
# under the same two conventions its own header documents: its extension is
# .bash (not .sh) so discovery can never match it, and lib/ is additionally
# excluded here as defence in depth so a future tests/lib/anything.sh cannot
# become a phantom fixture either.
