# bpftune dlopens the tuner plugins in /usr/lib/bpftune/ and keeps pointers into
# those mappings, so replacing the files underneath the running process kills a
# worker thread inside strstr() with SIGSEGV/SEGV_MAPERR.  That is measured:
# /var/lib/systemd/coredump holds exactly two bpftune cores, they are the same
# fault at the same offset, and each is stamped in the same second as the
# `pacman -U` of bpftune-git that rewrote the plugins --
#
#   2026-09-16 07:38:35  reinstall, crash in the same second
#   2026-09-16 18:57:50  reinstall, crash in the same second
#
# -- so the recipe has to stop the unit before the swap and start it after, and
# has to ship both halves.  This fixture asserts the assets, the packaging, the
# checksums, and the decisions the script actually makes against a stubbed
# systemctl.
#
# Red-verified: dropping either hook, mismatching the checksums, or inverting
# the marker logic each makes it fail.
