# tools/provides-audit.sh owns the soname-provides PRESENCE rule at artifact
# level: every DT_SONAME a built package ships must be covered by a declared
# provides entry. The tool is a host-side diagnostic (it reads real built
# archives), so it lives outside the battery; this fixture pins its contract
# at reduced scale against synthetic packages under $TMPDIR — the same
# two-adapter pairing as tools/go-modcache-check.sh ↔ tests/modcache-check.sh.
#
# What is pinned here:
#   * presence-only semantics: a declared bare stem OR the full soname covers
#     it — the FORM rule (declare bare) belongs to the audit lint, not here;
#   * the exact finding message, including the derived bare stem;
#   * archive input extracts under $TMPDIR only;
#   * inputs are never modified (a decoy that is never named must survive
#     byte-identical, and a named input must too);
#   * --quiet and the exit-status contract (0 clean, 1 findings, 2 usage).
